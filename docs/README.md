## Overview

Waggle is a graphing and debugging dashboard initially created for the CU Robotics team, however it has since proven to be a valuable, problem agnostic tool. This document is intended to get you up and running with your first graph in no time!

## Warnings

Waggle was built and is primarily maintained for the CU Robotics team. Some of the tooling can be a little disjointed or split across subdirectories in different repositories. That said, you interact with the main server through a simple API. If there's a tool you want or you need to spin up a waggle client in a new language, the process is fairly trivial.

## FAQ

**Why "Waggle?" Such a strange name...**

Our robotics team's main robot software is called "Hive," as it is one piece software that controls many robots. In a bee hive, the bees communicate with a [waggle dance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance). This is a piece of software to allow Hive to communicate, hence, Waggle!
